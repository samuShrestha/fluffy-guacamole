         <h2>A Quick Introduction</h2>
         <p>Websites, like this one, consist of many interlocking pieces that work together to form everything that you see.</p>
         <p>3 core pieces that make up a website are HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

               <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are what allow the developer to “stylize” their content. CSS can help define the font, size, color, spacing, border and location of HTML information on a web page.</p>

         <p>
            Furthermore, when creating web apps such as Social Networks like Facebook, or services like Netflix, such applications have to deal with data. Whether it may be your friend’s Relationship Status, family photos, or how many hours you’ve wasted watching “educational” documentaries, all of it’s stored in something known as a database. Often, these applications have to interact with such data, adding, changing, or even deleting particular information. Within the world of web development there exists a multitude of “conventional” options to go about integrating and manipulating data within applications, but recently, there’s been a new player on the field.

            <h4>More Universal</h4>
            <p>
               The awesome part about running Node.js is that both the server and client-side code is written in one language and can also be run on multiple platforms (desktops, mobile devices, etc.).
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="margin-top-45">
            <h4>Cross-Platform Compatible</h4>
            <p>
               Javascript can run on both desktop and mobile platforms, allowing an application to programed only once and then deployed to multiple device platforms.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="margin-top-45">
            <h4>More Efficient</h4>
            <p>
               Not only is utilizing Javascript as a server-side language simply faster, but merging the front-end and back-end into a single codebase makes development much faster!
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="margin-top-45">
            <h4>Better Suited for Real-Time Data</h4>
            <p>
               Node.js’s event-driven architecture makes real-time applications a lot easier, again due to a singular codebase, making the synchronization process much more potent and economical.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="margin-top-45">
            <h4>Backed by a Large Community</h4>
            <p>
               The Node.JS community is ever expanding and has a large collection of already user-made modules (reusable code) that can be used by anyone!

         <div class="margin-top-45">
            <p>
               <span class="lead">However</span>, it’s important to note with as amazing as Node.js seems, it isn’t an all-in-one silver bullet. Node.js is a solution to a particular need and understanding this is absolutely essential. You definitely don’t want to use Node.js for intensive computation (scientific data perhaps), that of which nearly eliminates all of Node.js’s advantages. Yet where Node.js really shines is in creating fast, versatile applications that utilize client-to-server interactions.

            Node.js is opening whole new doors for the web development industry. Currently, Javascript is the only language that is able to interact with the client (your computer), and with its actively growing community and wealth of technologies, it’s evident that Javascript is here to stay. But for now, Javascript is simply a trend with large potential. When server-side Javascript was introduced to the industry, it brought a whole lot of excitement and opportunity with it, but calling Javascript the future of web development may be a tad far-fetched. But the Javascript development stack (a development “process” in which a developer utilizes Javascript for the core aspect of an application, rather than a singular facet) is fairly young, and the future is open-minded, so Javascript has a clear start but still a long way to go.
